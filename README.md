Input: - There are two ways to input airport code - enter text in the text field or click on the icons. - Clicking on the text fields clears entry. - Clicking on icons automatically fills text fields.

Validation: - Invalid airport codes are detected and noted.

Style: - Hovering over icons displays airport code. - Background dims when displaying distance.

Browser Compatibility: - Best viewing in Firefox. - Fonts not rendering perfectly in Chrome or Safari (use screenshot as reference).

Future Improvements: - Lines can be drawn between selected airports. - Animations can be implemented on distance display - i.e rolling numbers, smooth dimming of the background, etc. - Code decomposition can be cleaner. - Clear data on clicking.

Scalability: - More airports can be easily added to the map and database.
